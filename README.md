*IMPORTANT NOTE:*<br>
This program for the SAVIOR BIN is still a work in progress.
If you want to copy it or Improve it make sure you reach out
to me by e-mail or other socials. This program is design for
the components I'm about to mention; HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor,
LCD 16x2, RFID, MQ-135 Gas sensor, Water level sensor, MG-946r Servo motor,
KY-037 High Sensitivity Sensor. The blueprint of the project is not yet publicly
available.

*DISCUSSION:*<br>
What inspired me to make this contraption?. Disposal of solid waste is a growing
problem for our world. So I invented this effective way of modernizing our way on waste
disposal. Combining my love for the environment and passion for electronics, I ended up
with this cost effective innovation of modern smart bins.
